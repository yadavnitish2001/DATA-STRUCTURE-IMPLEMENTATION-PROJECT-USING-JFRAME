# DATA-STRUCTURE-IMPLEMENTATION-USING-JFRAME
## Project Overview

Welcome to the Data Structure Implementation project! This project focuses on implementing a data structure with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java's Swing library and JFrame. The GUI provides an interactive way to visualize and manipulate the data structure.

## Implemented Data Structure

Specify the data structure that you are implementing. For example, it could be a linked list, stack, queue, tree, or any other data structure of your choice.

## Features

- **Visualization:** The GUI allows users to visualize the data structure in a graphical format.
- **Interactive Operations:** Perform various operations on the data structure through interactive buttons, such as insert, delete, search, etc.
- **Real-time Updates:** The GUI dynamically updates to reflect changes made to the data structure.

## Project Structure

Describe the structure of your project, including the main classes and their functionalities. For example:

- `Main.java`: Contains the main method to start the application.
- `DataStructure.java`: Implements the chosen data structure with relevant methods.
- `GUI.java`: Manages the graphical user interface using JFrame and Swing components.

## Screenshots

Include screenshots or GIFs showcasing the GUI and its functionalities.

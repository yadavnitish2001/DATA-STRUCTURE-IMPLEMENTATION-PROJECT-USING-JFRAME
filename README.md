# DSA Implementation using JFrame

This Java project demonstrates the implementation of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Java's `JFrame`.
The GUI allows users to visualize the workings of various DSA components, fostering a better understanding of these concepts.

## Implemented Data Structures and Algorithms

- **Stack:** Visual representation of stack operations like push and pop.
- **Array:** Dynamic array showcasing array manipulation and resizing.
- **Queue:** Interactive queue visualization with enqueue and dequeue operations.
- **Linked List:** Singly linked list with insert, delete, and traversal operations.
- **Circular Queue:** Circular queue representation demonstrating circular buffer concepts.
- **Doubly Linked List:** Visualization of doubly linked list operations.

## Usage

Explore each DSA component through the GUI interface. Interact with the visualizations to understand how these data structures operate. The project serves as an educational tool to enhance comprehension of DSA concepts through hands-on experience.
